# SONG REVIEW WEBSITE

Students across the country depend on music on a daily basis for several different reasons. Whether it be for motivation, relaxation, or concentration, music is an invaluable tool that all students can access to fulfill their needs. This is why it is imperative that students be given the ability to express their tastes and opinions in music by posting their thoughts on them via reviews and ratings.

With our song review website, we are offering students in particular the opportunity to explore a multitude of music genres that are tailored to their tastes with each review they make on songs they find on our daily updated list of music.  The more they search and review, the better odds they will have in finding their next favorite song for weeks to come.
